# GameSharing

This repository is for Project 2 for the CS5610 Web Development Course.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a full-stack web application (using Node, Express
MongoDB, and HTML) called GameSharing where general users or gamers can share their favorite
video games. This project is built around the idea for users or gamers to share their favorite video games and to raise discussions about their favorite video games. Users can
not only share their favorite video games through posts but can react to their own game posts as well as game posts by other users through likes, dislikes and comments.

--Yuanyuan: Really like your project's topic! The way how you put relevant link is very clean and cool. It will be better if you can put the class link here. (I remember the TA has mentioned that in slack, but not very sure about this point.) Overall very good job! --
